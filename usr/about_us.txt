Everything that I got I got from slanging birds

Niggas know I call my porsche the baby elephant
You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment
Everything I got I got from selling shit
And who I sold it to is irrelevant
Pocket full of Dead Presidents I'm With whatever
I pull my dick out and tell her sit whereever
I done stood on the block nigga from 9 to 9
And I sell a 9 at least 9 times
9Milla Clientel Look Like Thriller
If my baby mama cheating I Hope God with her
You not iler I'm Godzilla on hard liquor
My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH

[Chorus:]
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my mother fucker word nigga
That's my word
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my mother fucker word nigga
That's my word

I am slangin Chickens
I am slangin Hawks
I Take The 4 Up out of bricks bitch I can write in chalk
You know I know that white green like a chalk board
What you doin just chillin look like the top bored
So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a soup
Must be some owls in this bitch cause I keep hearin WHO
This for my niggas cookin 9s like they chicken breast
You know we tryna hide the 6s that's why the chickens dressed
I Had the lam Black and green like a parkeet
You know I ain't tripping
50 pigeons in a cherokee
Everything a nigga got is from slanging birds
What I ain't get from slangin blocks I got from slanging words... SNOW

[Chorus:]
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my mother fucker word nigga
That's my word
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my mother fucker word nigga
That's my word

[Yo Gotti:]
I got a Car that bitch is classy white on red
Inside out that bitch nasty
When I pull up on them 6s speakers blastin
Black scale white work clear plastic
And everything I got I got from sellin birds
Half a brick to do a verse I guess I am sellin words
That dubbed it up
Niggas send medranks so thadouble the cup
Got 2chainz bitch I'm icey as fuck
2brac on my arm that's a 100 and up
We sell dope it ain't none to us
New bitch new whip nigga change for what nigga change for
What and where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for sum
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up
My niggas grinding we banding up
These pussies know not to be playin with us... WORK

[Birdman:]
My bad bitch my money long
Car game filthy and my game strong
The kitchen hot

My neighborhood shot cus them cars hot
Nigga on some money shit
Got back on that other shit
Came with the fame nigga listen while you learn BITCH
Money is for show shit
Gettin it while we blow this bitch
All the time we gonna shine while we flowin' bitch
100 thousand on this watch
Living lavish off top
Neighborhood watch

The coke game strong

Nigga made it home
So we gettin it on

[Chorus:]
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my mother fucker word nigga
That's my word
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my mother fucker word nigga
